*Enterprises in all industries can gain a competitive advantage when they use no-code platforms. Here are some of the most useful benefits of no-code development.*

No-code development fundamentally shifts how enterprises build applications, allowing users to construct complex workflows without writing a single line of code. It’s a customizable, secure, and cost-effective solution that’s driven by ideas, not technical expertise.

No-code is shaking up industries and creating opportunities for businesses to develop applications in ways they didn’t think were possible. Here are the top five benefits of using no-code platforms in enterprises.

## 1. Speed: DecreaseTime to Market

Developers often end up sacrificing function for speed when it comes to enterprise app development. In today's saturated app market, consumers have come to expect quick delivery and seamless product experiences across avenues. In order to keep up with demand, developers often do all they can to get their products into the hands of consumers as quickly as possible to maintain their competitive edge.

No code offers rich functionality and the ability to turn projects around in a fraction of the time it would take if built using traditional or low-code options. No-code's visual interfaces bridge the the gap between idea and workable application, helping developers get products to market faster with fewer headaches.

## 2. Collaboration: Bridge Communication Gaps

In traditional app development, there’s usually some level of disconnect between business leaders and the IT teams that support them. Business teams will often outline directives, then pass them on to IT teams who work to build projects that may or may not hit the mark.

Traditional and low-code solutions amplify this chasm between IT and business teams, keeping things siloed. No-code changes this with platforms that promote transparency and cross-team collaboration. No-code allows business teams to see what's being built by IT teams in real time, ensuring that nothing gets lost in translation. And, since no-code platforms require zero coding experience, business analysts and engineers alike can get involved to help bring a product to life. 

## 3. Accessibility: Break Down Structural Barriers

IT work has been traditionally inaccessible to those without specialized knowledge. Within businesses, this manifests itself as a strict division of labor. Business teams bring ideas to the table and the IT teams bring their visions to life. This framework creates bottlenecks and project backlogs, as business teams neglect to weigh the impacts of handing increasingly complex projects over to under-resourced IT teams.

No-code flips this model, making everyone a part of the app development process, regardless of experience. By increasing the number of people who are able to contribute to applications builds, businesses can start chipping away at their project backlogs, saving time and money along the way.

## 4. Flexibility: Build on Your Own Terms

Traditional software development is rooted in legacy code and rigid data models. App developers must define all entities (e.g., which third-party apps need to be integrated) from the start, which can make it difficult to get a project off the ground. This creates a need for modifications, updates, an other labor-intensive process later down the line.

With no-code, your data is stored in a JSON document instead of a data model, allowing you to load data in a faster, more logical manner. No-code platforms and schema-free databases give you the flexibility to start building immediately, with full flexibility to adjust on the fly and completely redirect when necessary.

Within a schema-free database, you’re free to store your data without interacting with the previous structure. This allows users to easily group together data that would require much more work in a relational database. In short, with no-code you won't spend countless hours negotiating the structure of your documents again.

## 5. Cost Savings: Reduce Legacy Maintenance

Complex coding projects can take a toll on an enterprise’s bottom line, not just in terms of hiring specialized engineers, but also in terms of future legacy maintenance.

Legacy maintenance can be a huge drain on an IT department resources and company funds. Modifying or fixing an engineer’s work requires diving deep into code to perform time-consuming reverse engineering. Over time, this means that enterprises are paying for highly expensive developers simply to simply maintain a state of status quo. 

With no-code development, there is no need to maintain legacy code. Platforms like Rhinobase allow you to build custom applications without coding. They can also work alongside existing legacy systems, allowing your developers to keep what works and change what doesn’t. This results in faster builds with zero maintenance costs, and more time for business and IT teams to focus on what really matters — creating competitive advantage.
