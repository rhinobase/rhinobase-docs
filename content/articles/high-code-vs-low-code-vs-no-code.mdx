In today's day and age, there’s a common train of thought that **“every business is a software company”**, as said by Mr. Watt S. Humphrey, the father of quality in software and CMMI, two decades ago. This has been repeated many times by leaders of different large corporations, the most quoted being the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella:

>“Every company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company. It’s no longer just about procuring one solution and deploying one. It’s not about one simple software solution. It’s really you yourself thinking of your own future as a digital company.”

As Satya Nadella alluded to, companies in the past could rely on one monolith, off-the-shelf or custom-built solution. However, in today's world, companies need to think of a multitude of options when it comes to procuring digital solutions, which include **high-code, [low-code](https://rhinobase.com), [no-code](https://rhinobase.com), and even commercial off-the-shelf applications.**

With so many different specialties and departments in the mix, choosing the right solution for your organization requires multiple modern development approaches and solutions to creating new apps and services.

## Which Approach Should Your Company Take?
With so many options available to organizations today, let’s take a look at the different approaches and analyze the pros and cons of each one.

## High-Code

**High-code** assembly relies on **highly skilled developers to write and deploy code.** Developers will often rely on frameworks and programming languages like JavaScript, C#, React, Angular, or frameworks specifically designed for mobile or native applications.

This approach is ideal for a “code-driven” experience that is tightly tied to code deployment cycles. It supports the development of any type of software, from business applications to games. When using high-code you can excel in the implementation of advanced calculation algorithms and customized connectors between systems, but this usually comes at the cost of highly specialized and highly skilled developers.

When everything requires a developer’s hand, it takes time away from the more valuable work developers could be doing, such as creating new features and innovations.

## Commercially Off-the-Shelf (COTS)

On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have **commercial off-the-shelf applications.** These are **pre-built and configured to solve specific problems** like managing sales opportunities (CRM), website content, or digital marketing campaigns. Organizations purchase a COTS solution because there’s minimum customization needed or they need to automate a complex business process (like CRM), and using traditional code would be expensive and time-consuming.

Against traditional code, a COTS decision is straightforward. Time to value is months instead of years, plus the vendor takes care of maintenance and feature updates. COTS solutions historically are easier to set up, install and maintain than building the same solution in traditional code.

However, with the advent of no-code and low-code solutions, many of these dynamics have changed.

## No-Code

**No-code platforms** put business users directly in the driver’s seat. True to the name, these solutions involve **no need to write a single line of code** once they are launched. Instead, they rely on forms, configuration, and simple input tools to manage the experience.
